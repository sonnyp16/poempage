<p style="text-align: center;"><font color="#7A28CB">When she had left us but a little while,<br/>I still could hear the ringing of her voice,<br/>Still see athwart the dusk her shy half-smile</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then in her self-same tones I heard, "Go thou,<br/>Set to that work appointed thee to do,<br/>Remembering I am with thee here and now,<br/>Watchful as ever. See, my eyes shine true!"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I lookt, and saw the concourse of clear stars,<br/>Steadfast, of limpid candour, and could discover<br/> Her soul look on me thro' the prison-bars<br/>Which slunk like sin from such an honest Lover:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And thro' the vigil-pauses of that night<br/>She beam'd on me; and my soul felt her light.</p></font color="#7A28CB">
